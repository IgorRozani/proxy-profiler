# proxy-profiler

`ProxyProfiler` is a personal project that I started to study [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOP). Developing the code, I decided to include [Expression Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-tree/) for the purpose of study too. This quickly became a reasonable tool and I decided to make it a GitHub project.

You can use it as you like, respecting MIT license.

`ProxyProfiler` just keeps track of methods execution count, date and time of execution, arguments supplied to method and arguments after method execution and miliseconds elapsed to complete execution.
